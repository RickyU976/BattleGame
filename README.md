# BattleGame
 C# game working with OOP

This project was done with TeamTreehouse

In the C# intermediate course I learned how to develop a Tower defense game that involved:

*Polymorphism

*Abstraction

*Interfaces 

*System.Object

*Static classes

This course enhanced my essential principles of oject-oriented programming skills by working on this Tower defense game.
